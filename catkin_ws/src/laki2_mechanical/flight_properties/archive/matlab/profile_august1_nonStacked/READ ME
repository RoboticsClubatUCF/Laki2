Issues Fixed:
1) In speedCalculator, calculating climbSpeed was made more readable
2) In speedCalculator, when calculating climbSpeed, alpha for airDrag should be 0
3) In speedCalculator, calculating climbSpeed was very wrong, see lines 75, 79, and 84 for reference.
4) In speedCalcuator, moved calculating climbSpeed to climbSpeedCalculator. No reason to spend time calculating it if it is not needed
