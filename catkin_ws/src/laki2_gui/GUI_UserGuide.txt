USER GUIDE (Instructions):
  #	To add waypoints, determine which type of waypoint you want to add (Mission, odlc, emergent LKP, Search grid or FlyZone)
	
  # Click on the satellite image where you would like to add the waypoints, the server will be updated with the appropriate 
     	at that position. When finished adding waypoints, click the "Finish adding waypoints" button so that
     	you don't accidentally click and add more.

  # When connected to ROS, the current GPS position of the drone will be displayed along with the altitude.
